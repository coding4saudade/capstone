Outline the content of the application


What do I want on each page? (text / pics / images / navigation)

user profile page - site logo - form

event creation page - site logo - form  

home page - site logo - heat map of things of interest around them



What do I want the functionality of each page to be?

user profile page where they can update their hobbies and interests

event page where they can create and manage the event they are hosting

home page where they can see what is going on around them per their interests



What is the purpose of my application?

to help connect people to other people who are doing things of interest to them


What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?

to combat the lonliness epidemic

Research the following:
List Applications Researched: (links to websites / applications)
meetup.com
facebook.com

List what you like about each site:
I like that people know to use their sites for create events
notifications from users who are at the event

List what you do not like about each site:
meetup.com : only can see events but not interest 
                signing up can be cumbersome
                hosting costs money

How my application will be different:
            you will be able to see the interest of those around you
            you will be able to create an event easier without needing to manage membership
            only have to manage site, no ads, posts, or other distractions
            focus on creating events for the mundane things of life.  i.e. going to the grocery store, walking a pet, practicing pottery
